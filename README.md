## 🧹 Data Preparation

Key actions taken:
- Removed missing/null values and unnecessary columns
- Separated and capitalized joined product categories (e.g., `Computers&Accessories` → `Computers & Accessories`)
- Converted data into a structured Excel Table (`Ctrl + T`)
- Added calculated columns:
  - **Rating Score** = Rating × Review Count
  - **Price Bucket** = `<₹200`, `₹200–₹500`, `>₹500`
  - **Potential Revenue** = Actual Price × Review Count

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The following 14 business questions were addressed using PivotTables and formulas:

- What is the average discount percentage by product category?
- How many products are listed under each category?
- What is the total number of reviews per category?
- Which products have the highest average ratings?
- What is the average actual price vs the discounted price by category?
- Which products have the highest number of reviews?
- How many products have a discount of 50% or more?
- What is the distribution of product ratings (e.g., how many products are rated 3.0, 4.0, etc.)?
- What is the total potential revenue (actual_price × rating_count) by category?
- What is the number of unique products per price range bucket (e.g., <₹200, ₹200–₹500, >₹500)?
- How does the rating relate to the level of discount?
- How many products have fewer than 1,000 reviews?
- Which categories have products with the highest discounts?
- Identify the top 5 products in terms of rating and number of reviews combined.

## 🧮 Data Analysis & DAX Expressions

**Examples of Excel formulas and tools used:**

- **Extract Product Category**:  
  `=PROPER(SUBSTITUTE(LEFT(C2, FIND("|", C2)-1), "&", " & "))`

- **Convert Formula Output to Text**:  
  Copy → Paste as Values

- **Create Table**:  
  `Ctrl + T`

- **Insert Pivot Table**:  
  `Alt + N + V`

- **Custom Format for Revenue**:  
  `#,##0.00,, "k"`

- **Calculated Columns**:
  - `Potential Revenue`: `=F2 * H2`
  - `Rating Score`: `=G2 * H2`
  - `Price Bucket`: `=IF(D2<200,"<₹200",IF(D2<=500,"₹200–₹500",">₹500"))`

- **Review and Discount Filters**:  
  `=COUNTIF(F2:F1465, ">=0.5")`  
  `=COUNTIF(H2:H1465, "<1000")`
